                  <h1>ADHD</h1>
                  <p> Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (commonly known as ADHD) is a chronic condition characterized by a lack of attention and focus, and increased impulsive behavior. It often begins early in life and can continue into adulthood. ADHD in children can lead to developmental issues and learning complications.
                  Although the behaviors of one with ADHD may not seem dangerous, there can be very real consequences to a state of mind like this, and ADHD can lead to problems with relationships with friends and family or performance at work or school.
