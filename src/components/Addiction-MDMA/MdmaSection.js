                    <p>Commonly referred to as Ecstasy, ‘E’, or ‘Molly’, MDMA is a prevalent street and party drug that gives the user a heightened sense of euphoria, energy, and sexual excitement.
                    <br/>MDMA became more widely used in the 1970s and 80s, at which point the DEA officially placed it on the list of Schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 drugs are those that are most potent.
                    <br/>MDMA is an empathogen, that is, a drug that increases one’s empathy and compassion towards others. Continued MDMA use appears to affect the body’s dopamine and serotonin levels associated with substance use disorders.
                    <br/>Several factors determine any individual’s reaction to MDMA intake, including other stimulants present in the body, your body’s metabolism, preexisting conditions, the strength of the batch, and the dosage amount.
