              <h1>COCAINE ADDICTION</h1>
              <p>A highly addictive stimulant that affects the brain by elevating levels of dopamine (a chemical associated with reward or pleasure).
              Cocaine can be consumed by snorting, injection, or smoking. The most common of these is snorting. It is one of the most highly addictive drugs, as it releases high dopamine levels in the brain and reprograms your brainâ€™s reward system. According to AddictionCenter, more people are admitted to emergency rooms for cocaine use than any other drug.</p>
